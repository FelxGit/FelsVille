About
Fels Hive is a plant.

Laravel
1) composer install the latest package, make sure the current lara version is compatible. otherwise specify plugin/dependencies on composer.json
2) laravel ::create(), does one row at a time. but ::insert() could do more 
3) http request with laravel can not hold object array on controller param, only single value /sample/{value}
4) separate the admin from user
5) how to make api.php that use middle 'web' remove the '/api' on url? - ohhhhhh ok
6) 302 is a response redirect behaviour of laravel

Laravel Fun Facts:
1)

MongoDb
1) it seem laravel-mongo isnt stable yet( ex problem with eloquent query)
2) >with returns nested relation data to other model

Vue
1) how does custom event on router-view work? if its not built-in event, its an $emit
2) sometimes, npm installs are not stable. had to put cdn script under index.html for it to work
3) Vue.component(comp,require) to require and use globaly
4) Vue.use() is to use plugin globally, Vue.component() is to use component globally
4) dont confuse import with php 'use', import is also similar to require(), but 
5) on reactive data() update, refrain from using []indexes. and for existing object, use this.$set/Vue.set(). Even tho Vue 3.0 eliminate this.  
6) Vue 3 will bring state management along with its release. thus to have global-reactive data with vuex is probably not needed. 
7) vuex ..map() provide reactivty than direct access

Vue Fun Facts:
1) <router-view> is a component, you may $emit data from it <router-view @loggedIn="change">  

Validation
1) always validate the backend, front-end validations can be disabled and is merely used for server to avoid/recieve unaccepted values, and for faster process.
2) plugin/custom js validation vs embedded, either way they're javascript and might as well prefer plugin/custom js for flexibility

Extension for local
1) download ext for localhost(mysql_dll,mongo_dll,redis_dll)

Redis
1) redis understand only its won language, so serialize/json_encode if you want to pass array

CSS
1) default grid columns/rows size will depend on its starting point
